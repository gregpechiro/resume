# Resume

This project is an online version of my resume. Not only is it designed to present information about myself it is also a representation of my abilities. It's an opportunity to explain what I am capable of and demonstrate some of it at the same time.

This project was built with HTML5, JavaScript (JQuery), and CSS3. It is hosted on an Ubuntu virtual machine using Java 8 using Spring Boot. The data is stored on a MySql database.

I have created JSON rest end points for some on the data. The information is then retrieved with JQuery through AJAX. This is done to demonstrate my abilities and flexibility as well as to create lazy loading for some of the larger data.

If you were given login credentials, you can view the site [here](http://resume.gregpechiro.com).
